  instructions: |
    All specification compliance analysis resources have been published to your workspace.
    
    Created Resources:
    - Product: Spec Compliance Example Product (for organizing spec data)
    - Notebooks:
      * Spec Compliance Calculation.ipynb: Run compliance calculations on measurement data
      * Spec Analysis Compliance Calculation.ipynb: Combined analysis and compliance workflow
      * SpecfileExtractionAndIngestion.ipynb: Extract and ingest specification data
    - Files:
      * spec_template.xlsx: Example Excel template for specification ingestion
    
    All notebooks are configured with the File Analysis interface and can be run directly
    from the SystemLink file explorer or invoked programmatically.
    
    GETTING STARTED:
    1. The "spec_template.xlsx" file is a ready-to-use example that demonstrates the
       Excel format required for spec files.
    2. Use this template as a reference when preparing your own specification files.
    3. Upload your spec file to the File service and associate it with the product.
    4. Run the "SpecfileExtractionAndIngestion.ipynb" notebook to extract and ingest
       specs into your product.
    
    For detailed usage and format documentation, refer to the example README.
