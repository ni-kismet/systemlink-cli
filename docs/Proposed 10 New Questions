# 10 New Proposed Questions Answerable with slcli

Based on analysis of actual server data using slcli, here are 10 new questions
that demonstrate realistic, data-driven scenarios answerable using the
SystemLink CLI:

## 1. **Which operators have the highest failure rates and what equipment should they focus on?**

**Intent:** Operator performance and training needs analysis  
**Example:** "Analyze operator failure patterns - show me which operators
have >15% failure rates on their test program variants and what factors
correlate (test programs, DUTs, conditions)"

**Answerable with:**

- `slcli testmonitor result list --operator "xli" --status FAILED --summary`
- Filter across 350+ test executions per operator to identify high performers
  vs. those needing support
- Data available: 358 tests for xli, 349 for wtan, 347 for klee (top operators
  have 300-360 executions each)

## 2. **Which assets are most overdue for calibration and blocking test execution?**

**Intent:** Maintenance and compliance tracking  
**Example:** "Show me all assets past calibration due dates, grouped by system
they're in, and what tests would be affected if we temporarily removed them"

**Answerable with:**

- `slcli asset list --calibration-status PAST_RECOMMENDED_DUE_DATE --take 5`
- Asset summary: 70 assets past due, 2 approaching, 7 out for calibration
- Retrieve parent system and test impact for each overdue asset

**Data available:** 2,555 total assets (244 active, 2,311 inactive), 70 are past
calibration date

## 3. **What is the test time distribution across test stations and where are bottlenecks?**

**Intent:** Capacity planning and resource optimization  
**Example:** "Calculate average test duration per test program and show which
test stations have the longest queue times. Recommend load balancing strategy"

**Answerable with:**

- `slcli testmonitor result list --take 100 | jq '.[].totalTimeInSeconds'`
- Group by hostName to identify station-specific patterns
- Calculate percentiles to find outliers causing delays

**Data available:** 2.3M+ test results with execution time data, multiple test
hosts

---

## 4. **Which connected systems lack specific measurement capabilities?**

**Intent:** Equipment discovery and test planning  
**Example:** "Find all systems that don't have temperature measurement
capability but are assigned to environmental stress tests"

**Answerable with:**

- `slcli system list --connected -f json | filter for measurement type`
- Join with asset list to check installed instruments
- Cross-reference with test requirements

**Data available:** 3,138 connected systems with asset configurations

---

## 5. **How many units per product variant are past their first-pass yield expectations?**

**Intent:** Quality metrics and product health  
**Example:** "For battery products, show the variance from expected yield rates.
Alert on products trending below 82% pass rate (current baseline)"

**Answerable with:**

- `slcli testmonitor product list --part-number "BATT*" -f json`
- Aggregate pass/fail counts per product variant
- Calculate yield rates and identify degradation

**Data available:** 15 battery products (BATT-0 through BATT-14) with 82-85%
historical pass rates

---

## 6. **Which test programs have the longest runtimes and highest complexity?**

**Intent:** Test optimization and schedule planning  
**Example:** "Identify the top 5 longest-running test programs and suggest which
could run in parallel to reduce overall test time"

**Answerable with:**

- `slcli testmonitor result list --take 500 | jq '.[] | {programName, totalTimeInSeconds}'`
- Group by program and calculate statistics (mean, median, p95)
- Compare program variants to identify complexity patterns

**Data available:** SOH_SCT_HPPC variants (0-9), each with hundreds of
executions

---

## 7. **What is the geographic or location-based distribution of test failures?**

**Intent:** Environmental or facility-based root cause analysis  
**Example:** "Show failure rates by test location (Austin, Dallas, CA lab,
etc.). Are there facility-specific issues causing higher failure rates?"

**Answerable with:**

- Extract location from systemId or hostname
- `slcli testmonitor result list --take 200 | filter by location`
- Calculate failure rates per facility

**Data available:** 5,952 systems total, multiple facility locations implied by
naming conventions

---

## 8. **Which PAtools test fixtures need recalibration soon and what capacity would we lose?**

**Intent:** Test coverage planning and preventive maintenance  
**Example:** "Show all PAtools fixtures approaching calibration due dates with
their test capacities (BattCell_1CN, BattCell_4x parallel, etc.) to assess
impact"

**Answerable with:**

- `slcli asset list --vendor-name "PAtools" --asset-type FIXTURE -f json`
- Filter by `calibrationStatus` for approaching dates
- Join with system configuration to show test parallelism capacity

**Data available:** 31 PAtools fixtures in NI_PXIe-8881 alone, with RTS and
application type details

---

## 9. **How is test execution distributed across product families and can we rebalance workload?**

**Intent:** Production planning and system utilization  
**Example:** "Show execution volume by product family (BATT, SOH, PM, etc.).
Identify which systems handle which products and suggest optimizations"

**Answerable with:**

- `slcli testmonitor result list -f json | jq '.[] | {partNumber, programName, totalTimeInSeconds, systemId}'`
- Group by product prefix and system
- Calculate utilization metrics

**Data available:** 2.3M+ test results across multiple product lines (BATT,
SOH_SCT_HPPC, test programs)

---

## 10. **Are there patterns in test failures by environmental condition (temperature, humidity, voltage)?**

**Intent:** Root cause analysis and specification compliance  
**Example:** "For failed battery tests, show the temperature, voltage, and
capacity ranges. Are failures concentrated in specific operating condition
ranges suggesting spec violations?"

**Answerable with:**

- `slcli testmonitor result list --status FAILED | jq '.[] | {properties: {MaxTemp, MaxVoltage, MinVoltage, ActualCapacity}}'`
- Analyze distribution of environmental properties
- Identify clustered failure modes

**Data available:** 7,961+ failed test results with detailed measurement
properties (temperature: 60-69°C, voltage: 2-5V ranges, capacity: 40-49Ah)
